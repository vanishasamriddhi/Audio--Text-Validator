## Project Description 
 Description: There are few audio and text file pairs. This means when you hear an audio file, you are supposed to hear what is written in the corresponding text file. However, this may not always be the case due to errors in the audio file. 
It is required to find out the mismatched audio and text file pairs.
The goal of this web application is to provide an interface using which an user (also called validator) can listen to audio files one by one and see the corresponding text on screen and mark whether the two match or not. Keep two options as radio buttons:
1.Audio and text pair match
2. Audio and text pair do not match.

In case they do not match, an interface should be provided so that the words which are wrongly spoken can be marked and saved.

The users’ or validators’ responses should be stored in the backend database for all audio and text pairs
